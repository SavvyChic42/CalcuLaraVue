Introduction <br>
The masterminds at CalcTek have decided to revolutionize the calculator industry by building an API driven calculator. Genius! They've tasked you with developing the project.<br>
Requirements<br>
Build an API that supports four types of calculation operators:<br>
.Addition<br>
.Subtraction<br>
.Division<br>
.Multiplication<br>

Every calculation should be stored for historical reference.

A calculator interface should be created (Vue.js) that allows the user enter their calculation and receive a response.

A "ticker tape" interface should be built that shows all previous calculations with the ability to delete an individual calculation or clear all previous calculations.


Pre-requisites<br>
.PHP ^8.0.<br>
.A MySQL database connection with username and passwords<br>
.Copy the .env.example file and rename it as .env.<br>
.Fill the values of the database connection into the .env file.<br>
.Yarn or NPM installed globally.<br>

Installation requirements<br>

.Install required packages.<br>
